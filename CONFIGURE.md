# Limitations

The component tends to be generic and adapt to all supported models. However, Renault locks or limit some functionnalities based on vehicle model.
This page list them.

## HVAC
Hvac status is not available for Zoe50 (model code X102VE). But Starting HVAC is possible with service `renault.ac_start`.

The service `renault.ac_stop` does not provide errors, but it is assumed that is as no effect on the vehicle.
Following MyRenaultApp documentation, HVAC is started between 5 and 50 min.

This is an example script to start HVAC for Zoe50 :
```yaml
# Scripts
script:
  start_hvac:
  alias: Start HVAC
  sequence:
  - service: renault.ac_start
      data:
      vin: VF1xxxxxxx
      temperature: 21
  # optional notification to device
  - device_id: xxxxxxxxxxxxx
    domain: mobile_app
    type: notify
    message: Starting HVAC at 21Â°C
    title: Renault ZOE
  # optional delay to avoid multiple launch 
  - delay:
      seconds: 300
  mode: single
  icon: mdi:snowflake
```

This is and example of switch :
```yaml
# Switches
switch:
  - platform: template
    switches:
      # Start AC now for five minutes (see script)
      zoe_ac_start:
        friendly_name: "A/C"
        icon_template: mdi:fan
        value_template: "{{ is_state('script.zoe_ac_start', 'on') }}"
        turn_on:
          service: homeassistant.turn_on
          data:
            entity_id: script.start_hvac
        turn_off:
          service: homeassistant.turn_off
          data:
            entity_id: script.start_hvac
```
